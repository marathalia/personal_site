            Hi there, I'm Maria! I'm 15 and I was born a day after christmas.
            I am currently in my sophomore year at SMA Santa Ursula Jakarta.
            Prior to living in Jakarta, I've spent 11 years living in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
            I like watching movies and series, at least one title a week. 
            Before the pandemic, I play badminton on the weekends and basketball whenever I feel bored. 
            Iâ€™m not really into reading novels, but I like listening to podcasts on youtube and spotify.
        </p>

        <p class="info-more-about-me">
            From a very young age, I am used to the adaptation phase. 
            I've had the change to be able live in another country and experience a different culture.
            <!-- Although many say that there aren't much differences between Malaysia and Indonesia, 
            after living through the changes and experiencing it directly, I disagree. -->
            Several differences I experienced are differences in cultures, environment, teachings and languages. 
            Somehow to me, being in the adaptation phase is very addicting, because you can't really predict what will happen and how things will go.
